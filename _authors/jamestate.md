I've held many positions in my 25yr career in IT, starting out in storage and fibre-channel networking, to HCI and virtualisation and finally ending up in cloud and Kubernetes. I currently work as a Kasten Senior SE for the Nordics, Benelux, UKI and Middle East regions. My passion is technology in all forms, especially Kubernetes where I believe the future of the internet services lies, in fact I eat my own lunch....I run my many websites out of my homelab which would put most small businesses to shame. Outside of tech I live in the UK and have 3 retired racing greyhounds and my major passion is cycling.
